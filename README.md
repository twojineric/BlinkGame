To be considered a match, two cards can have the same number, color or symbol.

In the example below, Spongebob can play his card on both piles, as the left pile has the same shape (triangle) while the right one has the same number of pips.
Likewise Squidward can also play his card on both piles. The left pile shares the same number while the right pile shares the same color.
