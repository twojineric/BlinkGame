        Match cards in your hand to the cards on the pile, first one to get rid of all their cards wins. <br>
        <strong>Left click to send a card to the left pile, right click to send a card to the right pile. </strong><br>

        To be considered a match, two cards can have the same number, color or symbol. <br>

        In the example below, Spongebob can play his card on both piles, as the left pile has the same shape (triangle) while the right one has the same number of pips. <br>
        Likewise Squidward can also play his card on both piles. The left pile shares the same number while the right pile shares the same color.
        <br>

        In case there are no more possible moves, one person needs to click on the "no valid moves" button, and the center piles cards will change. <br>
